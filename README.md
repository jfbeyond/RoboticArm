# RoboticArm
Cartesian Control of a 7-DOF robotic arm using ROS and rviz. This was the final project for the Robotics class I took in my masters in Systems Engineering in Columbia.
The goal was to utilize motion planning for the arm using PRM (probabilistic road maps) or Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT). 

I wrote the code for the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) calculation only. The rest of the code was provided by the instructor where all the needed libraries were included and robotic arm basic classes had been defined.
