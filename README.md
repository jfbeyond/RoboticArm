# RoboticArm
Cartesian Control of a 7-DOF robotic arm using ROS and rviz. This was the final project for the Robotics class I took in my masters in Systems Engineering in Columbia.
The goal was to utilize motion planning for the arm using PRM (probabilistic road maps) or Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT).
